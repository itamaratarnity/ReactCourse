// This is a simple React component that renders a "Hello World" message.
// It can be used as the main component in a React application.
// To use this component, you can import it in your main application file (e.g., index.js) and render it using ReactDOM.render() or within another component's JSX.
// Make sure to have React and ReactDOM installed in your project to use this component effectively.
// You can also extend this component by adding more features, styles, or functionality as needed for your application.
// This component serves as a basic starting point for building a React application.
// You can customize it further by adding state management, event handlers, or integrating it with other libraries and frameworks as your project grows.
// Remember to follow best practices for React development, such as using functional components, hooks, and keeping your code modular and maintainable.
// Happy coding!
