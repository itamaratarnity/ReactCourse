// This is the main App component of a React application that uses React Router for navigation.
// It provides a user context for managing user state across the application.
// The component includes a navigation bar with links to the login page and the dashboard.
// The App component uses the UserContext to provide user state and a function to update it.
// It renders the Login component at the root path and the Dashboard component at the /dashboard path
// The navigation bar is styled with padding and a light background color for better visibility.
// The component is structured to be easily maintainable and extendable, allowing for future enhancements.
// The component is designed to be responsive and work well across different devices, ensuring a consistent user
// experience regardless of the platform.
// The component is part of a user authentication flow, allowing users to securely log in and access
// the dashboard after logging in.
